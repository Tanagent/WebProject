A project that allows users to upload photos to the site and have it slide through the individual photos manually.

The project will consist of a home page that will allow the user to upload any JPG file and have it all displayed in the front page. The file is named and then it will transfer the user to another page confirming that the picture is uploaded. Within the home page, the user is allowed to delete a photo as they wish by clicking on the delete button next to the name of the photo. There is a separate section within the homepage that allows user to record the information of each photo that was uploaded such as the creator of the photo, the creation time, the photo ID, and the name of the photo.
